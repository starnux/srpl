Superna's Reverse Polish Language
=================================

 This language is based on a "Prologin" Exercise, it is a primary
 language using a long integer stack.

 Look at scripts, you can use them with command line :
 srpl 1 10 < power

 Values on the command line are pushed on the stack.
 You can type the program by hand, it may finish by EOL (ctrl+D) or with a 
 line with only "."
